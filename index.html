			Recently, a common starting point for solving complex unsupervised image classification tasks is to use generic features,
			extracted with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pretrained on a large and versatile dataset (ImageNet). However,
			in most research, the CNN architecture for feature extraction is chosen arbitrarily, without justification. This paper aims
			at providing insight on the use of pretrained CNN features for image clustering (IC). First, extensive experiments are conducted
			and show that, for a given dataset, the choice of the CNN architecture for feature extraction has a huge impact on the final clustering.
			These experiments also demonstrate that proper extractor selection for a given IC task is difficult. To solve this issue,
			we propose to rephrase the IC problem as a multi-view clustering (MVC) problem that considers features extracted from different
			architectures as different “views” of the same data. This approach is based on the assumption that information contained in the
			different CNN may be complementary, even when pretrained on the same data. We then propose a multi-input neural network architecture
			that is trained end-to-end to solve the MVC problem effectively. This approach is tested on nine natural image datasets,
			and produces state-of-the-art results for IC.

			Object Detection (OD) is an important task in Computer Vision with many practical applications.
			For some use cases, OD must be done on videos, where the object of interest has a periodic motion.
			In this paper, we formalize the problem of periodic OD, which consists in improving the performance
			of an OD model in the specific case where the object of interest is repeating similar spatio-temporal
			trajectories with respect to the video frames. The proposed approach is based on training a
			Gaussian Process to model the periodic motion, and use it to filter out the erroneous predictions
			of the OD model. By simulating various OD models and periodic trajectories, we demonstrate that
			this filtering approach, which is entirely data-driven, improves the detection performance by a large margin.

			An understanding of the nature of objects could help robots to solve both
			high-level abstract tasks and improve performance at lower-level concrete tasks.
			Although deep learning has facilitated progress in image understanding, a robot's
			performance in problems like object recognition often depends on the angle
			from which the object is observed. Traditionally, robot sorting tasks rely on
			fixed top-down views of the objects. By changing its viewing angle, a robot
			can select a more semantically informative view leading to better performance
			for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce the problem of semantic
			view selection, which consists in finding good camera poses to gain semantic
			knowledge about observed objects. We propose a conceptual generic formulation
			of the problem, together with a relaxation based on clustering, to make it
			solvable. We then present a new image dataset consisting of around 10k images
			representing various views of 144 objects under different poses. Finally we use
			this dataset to propose a first solution to the problem by training a neural
			network to predict a "semantic score" from a top view image and camera pose.
			The views predicted to have higher scores are then showed to provide better
			clustering results than fixed top-down views.

			To ease the development of robot learning in industry, two conditions need
			to be fulfilled. Manipulators must be able to learn high accuracy and precision
			tasks while being safe for workers in the factory. In this paper, we extend
			our <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/783/1/012036/pdf">previous paper</a>,
			which consist in rapid learning of local high accuracy behaviors. By exploration and regression,
			linear and quadratic models are learnt for respectively the dynamics and cost function.
			Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian Regulator combined with cost quadratic regression
			can converge rapidly in the final stages towards high accuracy behavior as the cost
			function is modelled quite precisely. In this paper, both a different cost function
			and a second order improvement method are implemented within this framework. We also
			propose an analysis of the algorithm parameters through simulation for a positioning task.
			Finally, an experimental validation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot is carried out. This collaborative
			robot manipulator can be easily programmed into safety mode, which makes it qualified for the
			second industry constraint stated above.

			Thanks to their flexible mechanical design, modern industrial robots can be programmed
			for different tasks without physical modification. In addition, they are highly
			instrumented and should be able to be responsive to their environment. However,
			the use of robots in industry is still restricted to repeatable tasks with low level
			of adaptability. In an industrial context, it is essential to program robots that can
			autonomously adapt to different applications and are robust to changes in working
			conditions. The machine learning framework for robot programming is well suited to
			design such kinds of adaptive and robust applications. Hence, in this thesis, several
			machine learning contributions are presented, aiming at designing smarter robotic
			applications, with a broader operational range. The methods developed are centered on
			autonomous sorting, but may be useful to address problems in many other subfields
			of robotics. Throughout this thesis, we propose new approaches to image clustering,
			optimal view selection, trajectory learning and stereo localization, with the objective
			of designing more universal robotic sorting applications.
