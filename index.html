		I am an ecologist interested in freshwater systems and applied ecological issues on the meta-ecosystem scale. During my academic carrer, I have pursued research questions related to how anthropogenic actions may impact freshwater quality as well as the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems. Currently, I am a post doctoral researcher at the Freshwater invasion and trophic ecology lab, working on the SOLAKE project under supervision of Julien Cucherousset. This project aims to quantify the ecological impacts of floating photovoltaics on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of lakes.

			<b><papertitle>Precipitation, landscape properties and land use interactively affect
						water quality of tropical freshwaters</papertitle></b>
			<br>
			Regina Nobre

			<em>Ph.D. thesis </em> (2020)
			
			Nutrient cycling is a fundamental ecosystem service as it provides an adequate 
			balance of elements that are necessary for life. In freshwaters, the balance of nitrogen (N) and 
			phosphorus (P) are of special interest as they often limit or control primary production and biomass 
			formation. While the availability of these nutrients is fundamental for the maintenance of 
			biodiversity and productivity of freshwaters, their excess can lead to eutrophic conditions that are 
			associated with impaired water quality and biodiversity loss. The nutrient balance in freshwaters 
			can potentially be affected by a variety of biotic and abiotic, external and internal pathways. In 
			this thesis, two frameworks were explored. First, a spatial framework focused on external 
			processes, where we investigated the direct and indirect effects that land use (i.e. type, extent), 
			precipitation and landscape properties (i.e. lake origin, lake and catchment absolute and relative 
			size and geomorphology) have on biotic and abiotic properties of freshwater systems. More 
			specifically, in chapter one we evaluated, across 98 tropical lakes and reservoirs, the individual 
			and interactive effects of land use, precipitation and landscape properties on patterns of water 
			quality parameters (N, P and chlorophyll-a). In chapter two, we characterized the 98 lakes as 
			natural or artificial and compared them regarding the landscape properties of their surroundings, 
			their morphometry, and their physico/chemical characteristics to verify whether those factors can 
			be associated with average patterns of phytoplankton community structure at both local and 
			regional scales. The second approach, presented in Chapter 3, was a long-term temporal 
			framework focused on internal processes related to nutrient cycling where we assessed whether an 
			omnivorous fish with high biomass and growth rate is a source or sink of N and P to the pelagic 
			zone of a temperate eutrophic lake, at various time scales ranging from days to 20 years.
